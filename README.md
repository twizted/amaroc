Amaroc
======

# NOTICE
This is an old piece of code I wrote for my favorite music player - Amarok.
It is an ncurses application that communicated with Amarok via DCOP calls. I'm
leaving it here for sentimental value.

# Old README said:
Amaroc - a ncurses "frontend" for Amarok
RELEASE: 0.3

You need shell access to a machine on which Amarok
is running. SSH is just fine.
When you run it just hit the 'h' key for help.

That's it.
If you find it useful, do contact me and say so. :)
